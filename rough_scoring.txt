rough score mostly during

Non-engineering (admin, non coding, meta etc)
----- Basic fails -----
1. Bard: asked it to do a 12 hour plan and it came up with a 24 hour plan with working lunches, although of course the meta advice like "have fun", "be flexible" was great
a. when i pointed out the issue  it did a pretty good job fixing except "lost" the monday 3pm presentation idea

----- Surprise and delight -----
1. When i lessened the timeframe from its original perception it simplified user scope by eliminating suggestion of injury prevention but only pace prediction or something.


Notable capabilities
1.Scheduling help
2. seemed to handle scope well, conversion to just me, basic knowledge of figma for ux, etc not advancd knowledge like poweroint ai tool

in between admin and coding tasks,power user, table generration etc
Surprise and delight
--> Basic goal: Success!, overall grade "B+" so far
-- Basic fails
1) I tried to ask it to change a single column with decimal value like "24.5" for a duration to "24:30" for hh:mm type format
A) Format fail, changed nice looking html table to | | Tue | Cross-train | 30 minutes | N/A | +/- 10 | 2.4 | 32:24 |
B) Much worse, inconsitent occasionally inaccurate conversion-> 32:24 *does* seem like 32.4 for day2, but day 1 definitely is wrong, 24.2 does *NOT* equaol 23:58

confuse and annoy
1. i asked it to switch the schedule from 8am, 9am type format to hour1, hour 2 format,it worked but then gave this suggestion "Bonus: Consider incorporating visual elements like progress bars or time-lapse graphs to effectively showcase the use of elapsed hours in your app.", conflating, intertwining unrelated concepts


Notable capabilities
1. Holistic planning, ie reminding us to relax adn be flexible and allow pivoting and have fun etc.
